Looking at the overall IsisCB JSON-LD conversion project, there are several important functionalities that we haven't started implementing yet. Here's an assessment of what's missing:

## Major Functionalities Still Needed

1. **Authority Record Conversion Pipeline**
   - We've focused on citation records, but authority records (people, institutions, concepts) still need a dedicated pipeline
   - This would include specialized converters for authority-specific fields like classification systems, name variants, and external authority links

2. **Relationship Preservation**
   - One of the most valuable aspects of the IsisCB data is the network of relationships between entities
   - We need to implement converters that properly capture citation-to-authority, authority-to-authority, and citation-to-citation relationships

3. **External Authority Integration**
   - Converting external authority links (VIAF, DNB, etc.) requires specialized handling
   - Need to implement functionality to validate these external references and incorporate them into the JSON-LD

4. **Multilingual Support**
   - The conversion process should handle multilingual content correctly
   - Need to implement proper language tagging in the JSON-LD output

5. **Bulk Processing System**
   - For large datasets, we need a robust batch processing system
   - This would include resumable processing, error recovery, and progress tracking

6. **Data Cleaning Components**
   - Pre-conversion data cleaning to handle inconsistencies in the source data
   - Post-conversion data enhancement to add missing information or improve quality

7. **Round-Trip Testing**
   - Tools to verify that the JSON-LD conversion preserves all original information
   - Comparison utilities to identify data loss or inconsistencies

8. **Documentation Generator**
   - Automatic generation of documentation from schema definitions
   - Creating human-readable documentation for the entire conversion process

9. **Command-Line Interface**
   - A comprehensive CLI with all options and functionality exposed
   - Configuration file support for repeatable conversion runs

10. **Output Format Options**
    - Support for alternative serialization formats like JSON-LD compacted, expanded, framed
    - Export utilities for other RDF formats (Turtle, N-Triples, RDF/XML)

11. **Performance Optimization**
    - Memory usage improvements for large datasets
    - Parallelization of conversion processes

12. **Logging & Reporting System**
    - Comprehensive logging with multiple severity levels
    - Conversion statistics and quality reports

These components would together form a complete conversion system that could handle the full complexity of the IsisCB data. Given the project roadmap, focusing on authority conversion and relationship preservation would likely provide the highest value for the next implementation phase.
